    "\n",
    "Once we know where we want to move the foot and the associated goal positions for $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, we need to control the robot and make sure it goes there. It is generally not a good idea to just send the desired joint positions to the PD controller because if they are too far from the actual positions, the error will be large and a large torque will be applied on each motor. This will likely create a very jerky movement, potentially creating a very large torque on each joint which could damage the robot, its motors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear interpolation between initial and goal position\n",
    "Instead, we would like to create a nice trajectory that moves the robot from its current position to the desired goal position. One simple way to do that is to linear interpolate the desired joint angles from the current ones to the goal ones. For example, for each joint we could set\n",
    "$$\\theta_{des}(s) = \\theta_{init} + s (\\theta_{goal} - \\theta{init})$$\n",
    "where $s \\in [0,1]$. Doing so, when $s=0$ we get $\\theta_{des} = \\theta_{init}$ (i.e. the joint angle when we started the movement. When $s=1$, we get $\\theta_{des} = \\theta{goal}$ (i.e. the position where we would like to end up). For any $s$ in between, we will generate a line segment between those two positions.\n",

It means that as $t$ increases from $0$ (when we start the controller) to some $T$ (which is the desired time we would like the motion to last) we will get a desired position $\\theta_{des}$ and also a desired velocity $\\dot{\\theta}_{des}$ for the joint.
